<h1>ICE IEng and CEng interview: stock questions<a class="headerlink" href="#ice-ieng-and-ceng-interview-stock-questions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The ICE reviewers (or assessors if you’re an apprentice) will be asking questions to satisfy themselves that  the candidate either does or doesn’t have the attributes the ICE requires of a professional member. The reviewers have a free hand to choose whatever questions they want and normally the bulk of questions will be tailored to the candidate’s particular experience or anything that seemed lacking to the reviewers when they read the candidate’s report. However, there are some questions that come up pretty frequently. Knowing the answers to these won’t guarantee passing a review by any stretch, but not knowing them will look bad and could mean failing.</p>
<section id="understanding-and-practical-application-of-engineering">
<h2>1. Understanding and Practical Application of Engineering<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-and-practical-application-of-engineering" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>

<p>Don’t let this one catch you out. You might not do much structural design in your role but reviewers consider it perfectly fair game to ask any civil engineer to describe the forces and moments in a structure. Remember your rule of superposition.</p>

<h3>How would it affect the design if the soil was cohesive rather than granular (or vice versa)? Which is the more critical condition, when the soil is dry or saturated? What effect would compacting the soil have?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-would-it-affect-the-design-if-the-soil-was-cohesive-rather-than-granular-or-vice-versa-which-is-the-more-critical-condition-when-the-soil-is-dry-or-saturated-what-effect-would-compacting-the-soil-have" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The ICE won’t expect every candidate to be a geotechincal engineer. But these kinds of questions are what many reviewers would consider the geotech basics that every civil engineer should know. If you don’t do much geotech in your day job, you should brush up on the basics.</p>

<p>Some engineers fall into the trap of writing and speaking in a way you might for a bid or in marketing, and talk as if everything went fine and there couldn’t possibly be a failure. Reviewers want to know the candidate in front of them understands how a structure could fail and how to ensure (so far as is reasonably practicable) that it won’t.</p>

<h3>How did you verify the results from [some software or spreadsheet]?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-did-you-verify-the-results-from-some-software-or-spreadsheet" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Reviewers look very unfavourably on candidates who seem to place a blind trust in their tools. If you do use advanced software (or fiendishly complicated standard spreadsheets written by someone else), get into the habit of finding simplified methods of checking the answers are in the right ballpark and be ready to talk through how you do that.</p>

<h3>What formulas/methods is [some software or spreadsheet] based on?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-formulas-methods-is-some-software-or-spreadsheet-based-on" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Reviewers don’t like to think that the candidate in front of them has no idea how the software they’re using works under the hood. You might be using FEM, CFD or surge modelling software that they wouldn’t expect you to have an in-depth understanding of the method, but they’d at least expect you to be able to pull out the right names of the equations and methods (e.g. the method of characteristics, Boussinesq, Colebrook-White, Saint Venant or whatever it happens to be.).</p>
<p>A common, related question would be something like “what factors influence the bending moment capacity of a beam/flow capacity of a pipe/bearing capacity of a soil?”, this tests that you know more than the names of some equations but have a practical, working knowledge of the things that influence whatever it is you’re building/designing.</p>

<p>You should foster an attitude where you are ready to challenge things that aren’t safe. Even if you’ve never done this on a construction site you should be able to point to good examples where you have challenged things that are unsafe (possibly in a design you were checking).</p>

<p>If you’ve put a photo of something terribly unsafe happening on your project you might have all but guaranteed failing before you started. Unless, the reason it’s in there is because you sorted things out. Construction sites are busy places and it’s likely there will be something in almost any site photo that isn’t quite perfect. Scrutinise your site photos for minor hazards. It doesn’t look great if the reviewers see something you don’t.</p>
<p>For consultants make sure you have a good understanding of how the construction team practically built your design. This is crucial knowledge and vital to working safely as a designer.</p>

<p>Some engineers fall into the trap of being overly optimistic, saying things like “we eliminated all the significant risks” and can’t be drawn out to talk about the risks on the project. Another similar trap is being focused on the minor risks at the expense of major ones. This sort of thing will make reviewers concerned. As much as it has improved, construction is still high on the list of most dangerous industries. When a reviewer asks you this they’ll be expecting you to talk about things that cause fatalities, even multiple fatalities. They want to know you are aware of just how badly things can go wrong and that you are focused on the things that matter most; making sure people aren’t killed or injured on your project.</p>

<h3>Have you ever dealt with bribery or other corruption in your projects?<a class="headerlink" href="#have-you-ever-dealt-with-bribery-or-other-corruption-in-your-projects" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>If the answer is “no” (and often it may well be), a similar question may follow on other un-ethical practices, or you may be asked what you would do in a hypothetical situation. Read up on the ICE code of conduct and be ready to answer this kind of question. Think especially about how conflicts of interest could arise and reasonable ways of dealing with that.</p>

<p>There isn’t a right answer to this but you don’t want to sit there like a lemon not knowing what to say. Think about your dream job in the industry, describe how you’d like to get there. Sound enthusiastic.</p>
