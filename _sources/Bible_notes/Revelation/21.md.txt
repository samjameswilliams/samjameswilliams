## Summary
The chapter is a vision of heaven. Described as a new heaven and a new earth. A vast city. The bride of Christ. The sun does not need to shine because of God's glory. 

>$^8$*But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.*  

This verse led me to make an important confession of a past sin that I’d lied to cover up. Cowardice was a big part of the reason I’d covered it up, I was afraid of being seen for what I am, afraid of hurting someone who would be  affected. I was faithless in doing what I did. I was detestable. And then I lied about it.
