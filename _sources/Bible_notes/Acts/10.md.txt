Cornelius a centurion has a vision and is told to send for Simon called Peter.

He sends for him. At the same time Peter see a vision of a sheet with all kinds of animals on it and a voice saying 'kill and eat'. Peter says he has never eaten anything unclean. The Voice replies 'do not call unclean that which I have made clean'. Peter is pondering the vision when the men from Cornelius arrive. He goes with them.

Peter says when he gets there that God find believers in him acceptable no matter where they're from. 

The Holy Spirit comes in Cornelius and his household and the speak in tongues. Peter asks if they have water so they can be baptised.
