Paul is hounded out of Thessalonica by the Jews who don't like what he's preaching in the synagogue. Jason who is hosting Paul has money exhorted from him. Paul goes to Berea. The Bereans hear Paul and examine the scriptures to see if what he's saying is right, many come to believe as do some of the Greeks. After a while the Jews from Thessalonica agitate the Bereans against Paul and he goes to Athens. At Athens Paul's spirit is stirred when he sees the idols in the city. He preaches and is invited to speak at the Aeropagus where the men of the city do nothing but great of new things. He preaches to them about God, the maker of everything who doesn't live in temples, who has no comprehensible form, who needs nothing from us and from whom we receive everything. Some listen and some mock.
