Peter and John were going to the temple and walked past a lame man who was begging. They stop and Peter and the lane man to look at him. The lake man expects some money. Peter says he has no money but in the name of Jesus ride up and walk. He takes him by the right hand and he is strong and walks, leaps and praises God.

The people are all amazed by the miracle and gather round Peter, John and the man who was healed who was 'clinging' to them. 

Peter addresses the crowd saying that it was not him who made him well but it was in the name of Jesus who God has glorified, who they had crucified. You accepted in ignorance but now repent so your son's will be blotted out.
