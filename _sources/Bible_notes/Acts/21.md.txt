Paul continues his journey to Jerusalem. On the way he goes into the house of Philip. One of the prophets there took Paul's belt and bound himself with it and prophesied that they will bind the owner of this belt in Jerusalem. Paul says he is ready not just to be bound but to die in Jerusalem. Luke and the others all try to dissuade Paul but in the end pray for him instead.

Before he gets to Jerusalem a believer warns Paul of the rumours going around about him. He advises him to be accompanied by four men who will all ceremonially cleanse themselves at the temple. Paul agrees and to begin with they are accepted. But soon some of Paul's enemies stir up crowds against Paul, he's dragged through the streets and beaten. The Roman governor heard and send soldiers to intervene. As the soldiers are carrying Paul away Paul asks to talk to the crowd. The centurion is surprised that Paul speaks Greek and asks him if he's the Egyptian rebel he'd heard about. Paul tells him he is a Jew from Tarsus. Paul waits for the crowd to be quiet to address them.
