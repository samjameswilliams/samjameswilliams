Paul is brought before Felix. The Jews accuse him of stirring up trouble. Paul makes his defence. Felix has his wife come to see him who is a Jew. Paul talks to them both about the coming judgement and Felix is alarmed. Felix keeps Paul in custody but allows his friends to visit. He is hoping Paul will give him a bribe to release him. Paul don't do this so he remains in custody even after Felix is succeeded by Porcius Festus. 

## Observations
Paul's fortitude under injustice is remarkable. Luke says things in quite an understated way but the corruption on display is pretty appalling. Felix is clearly not a man of principle. In spite of this it seems that Paul witnesses to him faithfully and addresses him respectfully, although I do wonder if there is some irony or even sarcasm in some of the things Paul says sometimes. I wonder just how "cheerfully" Paul made his defence. I suspect he knew with what kind of man he was dealing.
