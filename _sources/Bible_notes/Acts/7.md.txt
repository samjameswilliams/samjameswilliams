Stephen gives a brief history starting from Abraham until the time Solomon built the temple. During this he alludes to a prophecy of Moses that God would send a prophet. At the end of the history he suddenly changes tack and days that the fathers of those who have captured him never followed the Holy Spirit, they killed his prophets and now you have killed the Holy one of God.

The crowd are incensed. Stephen see a vision of heaven opened and the Son of God sitting at the Father's right hand.

The crowd rush to stone him. As he dies he imitates the words of Jesus on the cross saying:

'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit' and
'Lord, do not hold this sin against them'
