A great persecution breaks out against the Christians and they scatter.

Philip goes to Samaria and preaches and cats it demons and many believe. Previously many people had listened to Simon the magician but now they listened to Philip instead and even Simon believed.

Peter and John came and prayed for the Holy Spirit to come into people because they had only been baptised. When Simon saw this he offered the apostles money to give him this power but Peter rebukes him for trying to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit.

Philip meets an Ethiopian eunuch on the road who is reading Isaiah. He asks Philip if the prophet is speaking about himself or someone else. Philip starts with this passage and explains to him about Jesus. They pass some water. The eunuch asks to be baptised, Philip baptises him and is then carried away by the Spirit.
