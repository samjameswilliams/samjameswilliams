I've been following the `Robert Murray M'Cheyne plan <https://bibleplan.org/plans/mcheyne/>`_.  since maybe 2004. Since becoming a father I've changed to doing the plan at half speed. I found it hard to really meditate on that much material every day. These notes are my attempt to make more of what I read stick.

The links below are all free online resources.

`Bible Hub <https://biblehub.com/>`_. Easy to navigate online Bible and study tools.

`Monergism <https://www.monergism.com/topics/free-ebooks>`_. Great selection of writings of the reformers, puritans and people in the great awakening. Includes Calvin's Institutes amongst lots of other titles. `Thomas Watson's The Godly man's picture <https://www.monergism.com/godly-mans-picture-ebook>`_ is a book I highly recommend.

`G K Chesterton at Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/80>`_. I read my first G K Chesterton book straight after reading Neitzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. I couldn't have chosen something better if I tried. Can't remember if it was Orthodoxy or Heretics I read first but Chesterton was like a breath of fresh air. He also happens to respond to Neitzsche's thought directly and compassionately with good humour, as is his style.

`Pascal's Pensees <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269>`_. I use his equations for hydrostatics at work. Didn't know till I read Nick Needham's histories he was a prolific theological writer too. I found the start hard going but worth  persevering with. Lots of profound stuff in here.
