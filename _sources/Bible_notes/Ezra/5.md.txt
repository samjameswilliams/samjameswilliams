Haggai and Zechariah exhort the people to restart rebuilding and they do. The revenues of the Jews oppose them. The Jews send a letter to king Darius asking him to look through the archives to see if king Cyrus ordered them to rebuild the temple and the walls of Jerusalem and to let them know his will in the matter. (They tactically avoid mentioning Artaxerxes' decree to cease building after Cyrus' decree)
