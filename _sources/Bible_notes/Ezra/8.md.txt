Ezra reviews the people who are to come with him. There are a lot of them but no Levites so he sends for some and they come.

Ezra holds a fast to pray that they arrive in Jerusalem with all the gold and treasures of the temple because Ezra was embarrassed to accept a guard from the king and told him God would protect them.

They entrust the treasure to the Levites and set off. They arrive unmolested with all the treasures.
