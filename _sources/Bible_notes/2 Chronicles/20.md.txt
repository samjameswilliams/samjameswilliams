## Summary
A great hoard comes against Judah of Moabites, Ammonites and Menuites.
Jehoshaphat is frightened and calls the people together to pray and fast.
Jehoshaphat prays, he reminds God that Israel were not commanded to attack the nations who are now attacking Israel, he asks for salvation, he admits his army is far too weak to go against the enemy. 'We do not know what to do but our eyes are on you'.
Jahaziel the Levite gives a prophesy, he says which way the enemy will approach but that the Lord will deliver Judah without them having to fight.
On the day Jehoshaphat reminds the army to trust in the Lord for salvation. The enemy army turns against each other destroying themselves completely.
The army of Judah takes three days to plunder the army.
Judah worships God and the surrounding nations are afraid to come against Judah during Jehoshaphat's reign.
In the last part of his life Jehoshaphat works with the wicked King Ahaziah of Israel to build merchant ships to trade with Tarshish. Eliezer brings a message from God that his work would be destroyed and the ships are wrecked at sea.
