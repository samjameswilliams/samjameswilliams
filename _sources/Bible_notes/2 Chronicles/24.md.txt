## Summary
Joash begins well. He orders the rebuilding of the temple. He sets the Levites in charge of it but after a while he finds they are not getting on with the work so he sets up a collection box and he and Jehoiada arrange for the workers to be paid directly and the work is carried out swiftly.
Once the work is finished they offered sacrifices to God.
Jehoiada dies aged 130 years. He is honoured by being buried among the kings for the work he did.
Joash mixes with the princes of Judah after Jehoiada dies and goes with them in worshipping the Asherim.
God sent prophets but they would not listen.
Zechariah, Jehoiada's son admonishes Joash and says God has departed from him. 
Joash conspires to have Zechariah killed. As he's dying he says 'may God see and avenge'.
The Syrians come and attack Judah with an inferior army to the army of Judah but God helps them defeat Judah to punish Joash. Joash leaves the battle wounded and is assassinated by some of his own men in his own bed who hated Joash's treachery in killing Zechariah.
Amaziah, Joash's son becomes King.
# Observations
Joash starts well but turns terrible. Maybe he never had a faith of his own. Jehoiada had a good influence on him but he never believed for himself and when Jehoiada died Joash didn't have any strength of conviction himself and is led astray by others. Maybe he was looking forward to throwing off the habits he'd taken on for Jehoiada's sake. Maybe he was easily led. Joash was clearly indignant at being told he was in the wrong and murdered Zechariah in anger.
