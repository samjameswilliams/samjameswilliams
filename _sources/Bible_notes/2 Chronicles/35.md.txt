# 35

## Summary
Josiah holds a grand Passover in his eighteenth year as King. He donates generously by providing the animals to be sacrificed but the priests and people add to what the king provides. It is the greatest Passover feast since Solomon.

Josiah goes against king Neco of Egypt. God has told Neco to fight Israel. He tells Josiah that he has no quarrel with Josiah so he should turn back. But Josiah disguises himself and fights anyway and is killed.

Jeremiah laments Josiah's death.
