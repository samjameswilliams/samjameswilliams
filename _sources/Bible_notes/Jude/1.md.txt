>$^{22}$*And have mercy on those who doubt; $^{23}$save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.*

Jude seems to me to draw a distinction between people who knowingly turn people away from the truth whom he says are bound for judgement and those who doubt or are drawn away by bad influences. Amongst Christians doubt can be treated harshly, Jude says we are to have mercy on those who doubt. I’ve found it hard when sharing my doubts sometimes how I’ve been rebuked. I don’t think that’s how it ought to be. Jude also calls us to strive to save people who are heading down the wrong path. This is a challenge to me but also an encouragement.
