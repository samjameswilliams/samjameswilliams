Esther is given the house of Haman, she gives it to Mordecai who takes Haman's position. Esther goes once more to the king uninvited, he again holds out the golden sceptre. Esther asks for the decree made by Haman to be revoked. The king says that any decree from the king cannot be revoked but Mordecai may make any decree regarding the Jews that he sees fit. Mordecai has it written that the Jews may band together to defend themselves and slay their enemies and plunder their goods. There is celebration and holidays where this is announced among the Jews. 

## Observations
It's remarkable to me that it is necessary for Esther to go again to the king to get something done about the decree. It seems like she has been emboldened after doing it once before but it was still a risk. King Ahasuerus seems to only concern himself with what is immediately in front of him.
