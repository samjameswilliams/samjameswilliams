Haman is at the feast with the king and queen Esther when Esther bursts into tears and pleads for her life and her people. When the king asks who is threatening her and her people she says it is this wicked Haman. The king walks out into the garden in a rage and Haman pleads for his life. He falls into the couch where Esther is sitting just as the king comes back in who asks him if he would assault the Queen in her own house. The servants come in and inform the king and Haman that the gallows are ready that Haman ordered to be built to hang Mordecai on, the man who saved the kings life. The king orders Haman to be hanged on it.
