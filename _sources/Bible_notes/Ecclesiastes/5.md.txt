*$^4$When you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow. $^5$It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay. $^6$Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands? $^7$For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity; but God is the one you must fear.*  

These verses are something I should meditate on more frequently. I’m too ready to say I’ll do things without thinking about whether or not I can. Jesus said to let your yes be yes and your no be no. Careless words aren’t befitting of a godly person.
