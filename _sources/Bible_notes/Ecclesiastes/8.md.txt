*$^{1b}$A man's wisdom makes his face shine,
and the hardness of his face is changed.* 

I find it very easy to think of wise people being very dour. The Bible doesn’t portray wise people like this at all so I really must try to banish this idea from my mind. Wise people are serious but they aren’t hard. Ezekiel famously has the prophecy about God removing Israel’s heart of stone and replacing it with a heart of flesh. God himself is wiser than anything He has created and He is gentle. I imagine the phrase “face shine” is meant to evoke joy and hope. It’s good to remember that these things accompany wisdom too.
