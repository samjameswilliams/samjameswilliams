>$^1$Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. $^2$Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and **you have not attended to them**. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD.

This admonition begins sounding like it is talking about leaders who deliberately scatter the people they are supposed to be leading. However, the phrase “you have not attended to them” shows that this is also (and perhaps primarily) talking about neglectful leadership, not actively doing something wrong, but failing to do what is right. 

This makes me think about how large a task it is taking leadership in the church. God expects leaders to attend to their congregation, to care for them, look out for them, admonish them, befriend them, love them, listen to them, help them practically and lots else besides. 

It makes me think how far short I’ve fallen in the roles I’ve had as youth leader and Bible study leader in the past. How much I ought to grow and change. How much patience I should have with leaders who fall short like I  have done myself. 

It also makes me think about how much the church needs good leaders and how it is good to strive to grow into the kind of person who is fit to lead. Even if you don’t get there maybe you can ease the burden of those in leadership by helping.
