The poor Jews are in debt to the rich Jews. They mortgage their houses and fields. They are selling their daughters into slavery. This is because of the famine and the kings tax. 

Nehemiah is outraged to hear that the wealthy Jews have been charging interest on loans to the poor and driving them to destitution. He rebukes them. They are ashamed and offer to return what was charged in interest to their brothers. 

Nehemiah points out that he does not take what he is permitted as governor for his allowance because he knows the people are struggling. He takes what he needs and he does not lord it over the people. His predecessors even allowed their servants to lord it over the people.
