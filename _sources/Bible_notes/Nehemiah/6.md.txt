Tobiah and Sanballat try to entice Nehemiah to go and meet them but Nehemiah suspected they wanted to do him harm so he replied that he should not abandon the great work of rebuilding the wall to meet them. They messaged him 5 times and each time Nehemiah responded in the same way. After that they said they'd heard the Jews were planning to rebel and make Nehemiah king. Nehemiah refused to be intimidated and told them they were making it up. Nehemiah was asked to hold meetings in the temple for his safety but he refused to 'sin' by being afraid. He thought Tobias was trying to make him meet there to show people that Nehemiah was afraid. There were a lot of Jews who were connected to Tobias and said good things about him to Nehemiah.
