# Coding links  

Here's a few links to sites I find really helpful  

## Python  

[Think Python: Allan Downey](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html). This 
is a really fantastic beginner's book for Python. Very highly recommended.  

[Python 3 Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp). I got 
started with Python using this course. Very well presented. 

## Bash  

[Bash Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
