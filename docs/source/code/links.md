# Coding links  

Here's a few links to sites I find really helpful  

## Python  

### Getting started

[Think Python: Allan Downey](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html). This 
is a really fantastic beginner's book for Python. Very highly recommended.  

[Python 3 Bootcamp](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp). I got 
started with Python using this course. Very well presented. 

### Learning more

[Real Python](https://realpython.com/): loads of really great articles, some very in depth, all well presented.

[Talk Python podcast](https://talkpython.fm/home) seems to have gone through a few name changes. Really good podcast, been going a long time so I tend to hunt for topics that interest me. 

###  Libraries I like

[numpy](https://numpy.org/)  

[scipy](https://scipy.org/)  

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  


### Tools I like

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) it's got lots of great extensions too.  

[ptpython](https://pypi.org/project/ptpython/) this is ace. Especially if you use it in ipython mode. You can do terminal commands whilst in the ipython REPL by prefixing the command with "!". Auto completion for terminal commands as well as Python, syntax highlighting, it's great.  

[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package management, package building, dependency management, version management, virtual environments, it saves so much hassle.  

[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) format and lint your code super fast  

[sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) used in creating this website.  

[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) makes testing your code so much easier than Python's built in unit test.  

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) I started writing all my code in Jupyter notebook, then for a long time Jupyter Lab was my IDE of choice, I only moved to VS Code once the support for running Jupyter notebooks got up to the level of Jupyter Lab. I still use .ipynb files all the time. Great for experimenting and for creating presentable calculations.  

[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) use this to install Poetry, ptpython, Ruff and anything else you want to use across projects.  

## Bash  

[Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) run a full Linux kernel in Windows. Get the best of both worlds.
