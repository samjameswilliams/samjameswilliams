# Vauxhall Intellilink - no audio fix. 

I lost the audio on my Intellilink stereo recently (seems to happen in cold weather but it's always come back previously). It still made beeps when you pressed buttons or the touch screen but no radio, iPhone or mobile hands free audio. 

For me I just needed to hold down. 

`home` + `right shift`.  

The audio returned almost instantly.

Looks like there are a few variations of model and/or firmware so if this doesn't work you can try reading this [forum thread](https://www.corsaeforums.co.uk/threads/no-sound-on-any-audio-input.2514/page-2?nested_view=1&sortby=oldest).
