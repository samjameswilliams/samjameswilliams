Nehemiah is sad in front of the king who notices and asks him why. Nehemiah is afraid so he quickly prays and then explains he is sad because his father's city, Jerusalem is in ruins. The king asks what he wants. Nehemiah asks to go and rebuild the city. The king asks how long he will be. Nehemiah tells him and the king lets him go and sends letters with him.

Some local Arabs mock Nehemiah and suggest he is traveling against the king.

The Israelites are enthusiastic and get to work.
