# 10

The chapter starts with a genealogy. After that it is an exhortation to pledge to follow God's ways and commands. It mentions 
+ not buying or selling on the Sabbath
+ not marrying outside of Israel
+ keeping the feasts
+ not exacting every debt
+ tithing
+ giving the temple tax
Some of these things are things that the people disobeyed in a direct way that we read about in Nehemiah and Ezra.
