Nehemiah asks travelers who have visited Jerusalem how it is with his people. They tell him that it isn't going well. The walls of Jerusalem are in ruins.

Nehemiah weeps for his people and Jerusalem. He prays to God asking for forgiveness for the people, himself and his family. He confesses that they have all broken God's commandments. He prays that God will bless them.

Nehemiah is the cupbearer to the King.
