## Summary
John is asked to measure the temple except the outer court because it will be given to God's enemies.
Two prophets are foretold who are described as having incredible powers:
+ Turning water into blood
+ bringing plagues as often as they choose
+ Fire pours out of their mouths and consumers their enemies
+ They can stop the rain

After they finish their testimony the Beast will kill them. For three and a half days they will lie dead in the streets of the city called symbolically Sodom and Egypt. Their enemies will be glad and give each other presents. 
But the breath of God brings them back to life and God calls them up to heaven. When they go an earthquake kills 7000 people in the city. The survivors give glory to God.
The 24 elders worship God.
