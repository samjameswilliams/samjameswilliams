+ Star falls to earth
+ Opens the shaft to the bottomless pit
+ Smoke billows out
+ Smoke contains locusts with the power of scorpions who torment those who don't have the seal of God for 5 months but not to kill them
+ In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,  their hair like womenâ€™s hair, and their teeth like lionsâ€™ teeth; they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. They have tails and stings like scorpions
+ The King over the locusts is an angel called Abbadon
