The angel swears by the creator of heaven and earth that there would be no more delay but when the seventh angel sounds the ðŸŽº the mystery of God predicted through his prophets would be revealed.
John is told to take the scroll from the angel. When he does the angel tells him to take it and eat it and it will be sweet in his mouth but will turn bitter in his stomach. John takes it and eats it and it is just like the angel said.
