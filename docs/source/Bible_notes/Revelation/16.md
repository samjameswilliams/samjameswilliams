## Summary
A loud voice tells the angels to pour out the 7 bowls of wrath
1. Boils and sores on the people with the mark of the beast
2. Poured in the sea which became blood and every living thing in the sea died
3. Poured into the rivers and springs which became blood
4. Poured on the sun and the sun scorched people but they cursed God and didn't repent
5. Poured out on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was plunged into darkness
6. Poured out on the River Euphrates which was dried up. The dragon, the beast and the false prophet have 3 evil spirits that look like frogs come from their mouths. The frogs assemble the kings of the earth for battle at Armageddon.
7. Poured into the air and there's thunder, lightning and a great earthquake. A voice says 'it is done' the mountains and Islands disappear and great hail falls.
