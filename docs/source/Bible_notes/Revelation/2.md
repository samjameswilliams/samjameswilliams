>$^4$*But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. $^5$Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.*

Jesus says this to the church in Ephesus. They had been through a lot of suffering and hardship, and perhaps as a result had lost sight of the greatest commandment. I haven’t been through the same kind of trials as the Ephesians, but I can see how I have let my love grow cold for old friends, family, church, even my wife and children. Jesus says to the Ephesians to do the works they did at first. Love can be nurtured, if we find ourselves having lost a godly love for someone we should remember to “repent, and do the works you did at first”.
