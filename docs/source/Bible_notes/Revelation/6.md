# Questions
* What happened to the mountains? Is it proof of non literal meaning that the mountains are removed and then people hide in them?
* What do the horsemen represent? Periods of time characterised by the things they represent? 
* Do the events described come one after the other or is it the revelation of various mysteries where were don't know the chronology?
* The stars falling to earth like figs also sounds like it must be symbolism rather than describing literal events. It also can't be literal because in chapter 8 we read that a third of the stars cease shining after one of the trumpets.
