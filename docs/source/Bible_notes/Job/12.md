Job begins his response to Zophar with a remark that is even more cutting than Zophar's 
*But a stupid man will get understanding
when a wild donkey's colt is born a man!*
Saying:
*No doubt you are the people,
and wisdom will die with you*
There's something arresting about Job's rebuke. It reminds us of our mortality. Job is rebuking Zophar for his superior attitude and for acting like a saviour when he's just a foolish mortal man who doesn't know how to help his friend. 
Job continues his speech emphasising God's superior knowledge, power and wisdom over mankind. Saying how man is powerless before him.
