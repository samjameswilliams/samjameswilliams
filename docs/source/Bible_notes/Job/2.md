## The Accuser

Satan is called "the accuser" in Revelation 12 and he lives up to this name accusing Job of being mercenary, only appearing to love God because God has blessed him, but that he would curse God if what he has was taken from him. We come to see that this is a false accusation and God points out to Satan that Job has not cursed him as he predicted. But Satan stands by his assertion that Job can be made to curse God and God allows Satan to harm Job's body, so long as he spares his life. Job refuses to curse God after Satan has given him a terrible skin disease and even when his wife in her distress says he should "curse God and die". 

Satan wants to discourage Job and anyone else who loves God. Injustice is discouraging. When bad things happen to good people it is easy to blame God, to call him unjust when it is us who are unjust. 

Furthermore it is a temptation to think "why should I try to be good, if I seem to be being punished as if I've  done something wrong?" Sadly this seems to be a very human response to unjust suffering.

It is clear if you look around that the world is full of injustice. God does not promise us justice here and now. 

Many people believe Satan's caricature of God as an unfair, unjust, arbitrary bully. God does judge, but his judgements are fair and he is merciful and gracious and has provided a way to be forgiven, giving his own son to pay the penalty for the sins of people who trust in him. Satan's caricature of God is in fact an accurate description of himself. 

We need to be avoid the temptation to be an accuser ourselves, to look for  other people's downfall, to make unfair accusations and to punish without cause. Unfortunately our human nature can lead us into all these things in various ways. We also need to  not avoid giving rebuke where needed, but out of love and a desire to help. Getting this right is often very challenging.
