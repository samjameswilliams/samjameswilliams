Job prays for his children in case any of them have cursed God in their hearts. This is an amazing concern for their spiritual good.

Satan is shown to be very powerful through the calamities he causes to happen to Job's possessions and children. Yet it seems that Satan can only do what God allows him to do. The hard thing to understand is why God allows Satan to do evil when he asks to. What is it that makes the difference between what God allows and what he doesn't? Even with what God does allow he places limits. 

We can surmise that Satan in general must be held back from doing what he wants because it seems that he is ready and eager to kill and destroy. 

Job is given a string of bad news on the day Satan does what he wants. It's so bad and so sudden and so concurrent the effect is almost comical it seems so unlikely. But it was true and for Job his life changed suddenly, the children he loved were gone and the vast majority of his wealth was gone too. It is remarkable how Job's reaction is to worship God. And he says something very poignant

Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. 
Job 1:20-21
