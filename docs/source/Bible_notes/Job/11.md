Zophar is much more to the point than Eliphaz. Eliphaz hints that Job's troubles might stem from some hidden sin. Zophar says it much more brazenly. He also hints that Job is stupid, or at least he might. He doesn't make it entirely clear he's talking about Job when he makes his comments about how stupid men never get understanding. 

He seemingly goes on to say how you can make amends in the eyes of God by changing your ways. He's really got the wrong idea about God and Job.
