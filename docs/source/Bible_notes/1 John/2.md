>*$^9$Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. $^{10}$Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. $^{11}$But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.* 

These verses are always very challenging. Loving people is always hard is some ways, some situations, some people. The call to love isn’t just when it’s easy.
