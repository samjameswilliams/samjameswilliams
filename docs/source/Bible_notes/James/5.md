>*$^9$ Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.* 

It’s so easy to fall into a habit of grumbling about one another. In the context “one another” surely means Christians grumbling about each other. Actually, it’s noteworthy that James uses the phrase “one another”, not “each other”. “One another” stresses the unity that should exist amongst believers, the way we belong to one another. God is judge we are told, surely this means we are to be content to leave judgement to God and strive to be at peace however difficult that may be. 

>*$^{12}$But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.* 

The meaning of this verse couldn’t be clearer but how difficult it is to be completely true to my word. 

>*$^{19}$My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back, $^{20}$let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.*
