## Summary
Jehoiada builds a conspiracy to overthrow Athalia and put Joash in her place as King. He enlists the support of the Levites and refers to God's promise to keep an heir of David on the throne.
According to plan Joash is proclaimed King to popular support.
Athalia cries out 'treason!' when she sees Joash proclaimed King. Jehoiada orders her to be dragged out of the temple with any who follow her and she is put to death by the horse gate.
Jehoiada makes a covenant between himself, the people and the King that they would be the Lord's. They tear down the altars to Baal and kill his priest. Jehoiada sets guards over the holy place to keep the unclean out of it, he reinstates the sacrifices and sung worship. They put Joash on the throne.
# Observations
God uses evil men to judge other evil men in places. I think Jehu is a good example of this. He destroys the house of Ahab but (if memory serves me right) he's not a good man himself. Jehoiada on the other hand seems to be set forth as a good man. It is interesting then that he carries out this conspiracy against the Queen. It raises the question of if and when it is good to subvert and overthrow the current ruler. This is not something to be taken at all lightly.
