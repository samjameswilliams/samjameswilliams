## Summary
Hezekiah calls for the Passover to be reinstated. The priests and Levites are not consecrated so it takes some time to prepare.
Hezekiah calls the people to turn back to the Lord. He sends messengers throughout the land to spread the message but many people laughed at the message, but some obeyed.
The Passover is celebrated but there are many who are not properly consecrated. Hezekiah and God to look at their hearts and ignore their uncleanness if they desire to return to him and God hears his prayer.
The people feasted 7 days with much gladness. At the end they wanted to stay so they celebrated the Passover another 7 days. Many more of the priests and Levites consecrated themselves. There had been nothing like this since Solomon.
# Observation
It is touching to me how Hezekiah is patient with the people who want to turn back to the Lord but are ignorant of his ways so don't follow the ceremony properly. He is concerned about them and prays to God on their behalf that God would not be offended by them. God listens to Hezekiah's request.
