# 31

## Summary
After the Passover everyone present in Jerusalem went throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh cutting down the Asherim and breaking down idols until there were none left.
The priests and Levites are organised. Hezekiah himself provides for the burnt offerings. The people bring in their tithes and there is an abundance of offerings. The priests and Levites have more than they can eat.
