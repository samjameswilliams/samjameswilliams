## Summary
Jehoshaphat is buried with his fathers. Jehoram his firstborn becomes King in his place at the age of 32. He had 6 brothers, Jehoshaphat had given them gifts and cities.
Jehoram kills all his brothers. He goes the way of the kings of Israel. Ahab's daughter was his wife. The Lord is not willing to destroy the house of David because of his covenant.
Edom revolts.
Jehoram builds high places and encourages idolatry.
Elijah admonishes Jehoram for leading Judah into idolatry and for murdering his brothers. He says the Lord will bring a plague on his people, wives, children and possessions and Jehoram will have sickness.
The Philistines and Arabians attack, carry away his possessions, wives and all apart from his youngest son Jehoahaz.
Jehoram becomes ill in his bowels and after two years they come out and he dies in agony. Jehoram is not buried with his Fathers, no fire is lit in his honour and he is not mourned.
# Observations
Jehoshaphat was generally a good King but his main weakness, sympathy with the bad Kings in Israel, had a lot to do with his son turning away from God.
