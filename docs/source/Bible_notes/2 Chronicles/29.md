# 29

## Summary
Hezekiah becomes King at 25 years old and reigns 29 years.
He ordered the temple to be cleaned and for God to be worshipped as he ought. He was concerned to turn away God's wrath for Judah's unfaithfulness.
The priests set to work and consecrate the temple for use.
As soon as the temple is ready Hezekiah leads the people in offering sacrifices and worshipping God to the words of David. The people bring so many animals for sacrifice that the priests can't cope and they get help from the Levites.
