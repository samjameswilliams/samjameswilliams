## Summary
Jehoram's youngest son Ahaziah (aka Jehoahaz) is made king of Judah, the Arabians had killed all the other sons.
Ahaziah goes the way of Ahab because of his counselors including his mother.
He goes with Ahab's son Jehoram (aka Ahaziah and Joram (confusing)) to war with Hazael King of Syria at Ramoth Gilead.
Joram is wounded and goes to Jezreel. Ahaziah goes to see him. When he goes there he meets with Jehu who God has appointed to destroy the house of Ahab who kills Ahaziah and the princes of Judah along with Joram and Ahab's descendents.
Jehu buries Ahaziah out of deference to the memory of Jehoshaphat.
Athalia, Ahaziah's mother ordered all the royal family to be put to death so she could take control. But Ahaziah's son Joash is hidden by Jehoshabeath (Ahaziah's sister) and Jehoiada the priest (her husband) so he isn't put to death. He is hidden for 6 years.
# Observations
+ Wow these King's names are confusing, they're named the same as each other and have several variants of their names.
+ We aren't given any details of Ahaziah's idolatry in the way we hear about his Father's
+ Ahaziah doesn't get a visit from a prophet
