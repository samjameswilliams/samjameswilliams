# 25

## Summary
Amaziah was 25 when he began to reign and reigned 29 years. He did what was right but not with his whole heart. He put to death the men who had killed his father once he was established but not their sons because of the law of Moses.
He assembled an army of 300,000 from Judah and Benjamin and hired 100,000 more from Israel to fight Edom. A prophet told Amaziah to leave behind the Israelite soldiers. Ahaziah asked about the 100 talents of silver he'd hired them with. The prophet said he would gain far more than that.
Amaziah defeats the Edomites. The Israelite soldiers are angry and raid Judah as they return home.
Amaziah brings the Edomite idols back with him and worships them. A prophet asks Ahaziah why he's turned to gods that did not save their own people. Ahaziah refuses to hear any more but the prophet says God has determined to destroy him for his idolatry.
Amaziah picks a fight with Joash King of Israel. Joash tries to dissuade Amaziah from fighting with him saying Judah is far too weak and Ahaziah's victory against Edom has gone to his head. Amaziah goes against him anyway and is defeated, the walls of Jerusalem are torn down, the temple is raided and prisoners are carried away. Amaziah stays on the throne after the defeat but a conspiracy grows against him. When he finds out he goes to Lachish but he is assassinated there.
