## Summary
Jotham becomes king at the age of 25 years old and reigns for 16 years (dies at 41, pretty young). He is a good King. He walks in the way of his father Uzziah except that he doesn't go in to the temple to make sacrifices so he is better than his father in following the Lord. He builds fortresses and is successful in wars against the Ammonites who pay tribute to him. When he dies he is buried in the city of David.
# Observations
We don't find out much about Jotham. Why does he die so young? He is liked by the people, they bury him in the city of David, an honour they don't give to bad kings.
