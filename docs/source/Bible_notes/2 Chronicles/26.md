## Summary
Uzziah becomes King at 16 years old. He reigns 52 years. Zechariah taught him to seek God.
Uzziah is successful against the Philistines, Ammonites, Menuites and Arabians. Uzziah builds a strong army and fortifications. He makes sure the land is tended well and pays attention to farming, and cut out many cisterns, 'he loved the soil'. He also has machines of war manufactured and installs them in his battlements.
When he was strong he grew proud and entered the Holy place to offer incence to God. Azariah and 80 other priests go in after him to tell him that he has not done right and it is not the King's place to offer sacrifice to God. Uzziah is angry at being chastened but before he can respond leprosy breaks out on his forehead. The priests rush him out of the temple and he is a leper the rest of his days. As a leper he lived in a seperate house and his son Jotham looked after the kingdom.
When he died he was buried with the Kings and Jotham his son ruled in his place.
# Observations
Despite the terrible way Ahaziah's ended his life he is still held up as a good King and it seems to be a good thing that Uzziah followed in his footsteps.
Uzziah never turns to idolatory like his father. His sin is of a different sort, he wants to worship God in his own way rather than God's.
Uzziah is wise to look after the interests of his people in the way he does. The ways he builds up the nation provide military and economic security.
