# 5

The phrase *”my sister, my bride“* is repeated many times in the book. Chapter 5 isn’t its first appearance by a long shot. I’m sure “sister“ is being used in a figurative sense because marrying your sister would be against the law. 

>*You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether brought up in the family or in another home.
>Leviticus 18:9*

My guess at the reason for the phrase (which I think a lot of people recoil at) is that the husband is trying to convey the companionship and friendship in the relationship as well as the sexual attraction. It’s a phrase I think is meant to get across that there’s lots of aspects to the relationship.
