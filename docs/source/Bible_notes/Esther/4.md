Mordecai comes to the kings gate in ages and sackcloth weeping because of the decree. Esther sends a eunuch with clothes for him but he refuses them. Esther asks the eunuch to ask what is wrong so Mordecai tells her about Haman's decree and commands her to go to the king to plead for her people. Esther is afraid, the king puts people to death if they come when they are not summoned and she hasn't been summoned in thirty days. The king has to hold out his sceptre to show he wishes to spare someone who comes without summons. Mordecai says she should not expect to escape, that if she doesn't help that salvation will come from somewhere else but that her household will perish finally he says that maybe she is where she is for such a time as this. After this Esther asks Mordecai and the Jews to fast for her for three days after which she will go to the king and if she perishes, she perishes. 

## Observations
It is very odd how Mordecai displays such faith without mentioning God. Likewise with Esther, she asks for fasting but didn't mention prayer.
