Haman is appointed to be second in the kingdom. All men are meant to bow to him but Mordecai refuses. Some of the king's servants ask him why he does not bow but he carries on refusing to bow. They tell Haman who is outraged. He is so angry he doesn't just want to kill Mordecai but all of the Jews. For 11 to 12 months he casts lots before speaking to the king. He insinuates that the Jews are insubordinate and it is not good for the king to tolerate them so they should be destroyed. The king agrees and an edict is sent to every province in the kingdom with the date the Jews are to be destroyed. 

## Observations
Mordecai is brave to refuse to bow. No mention is made of anyone else refusing so maybe none of the other Jews stood with him. Or maybe Mordecai was noticed because of his position. Either way it would have taken courage. 

Haman is an example of what pride and arrogance can make us become.
