>$^{28}$Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” $^{29}$Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”

>$^{44}$No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.

>$^{52}$The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” $^{53}$So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. $^{54}$Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. $^{55}$For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. $^{56}$Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. $^{57}$As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me, he also will live because of me. $^{58}$This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like the bread the fathers ate, and died. Whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”
