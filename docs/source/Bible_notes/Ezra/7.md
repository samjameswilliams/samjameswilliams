Ezra is given leave to go to Jerusalem by King Artaxerxes (who is probably King Artaxerxes II and may be the Xerxes/Ahasuerus from Esther, not the same Artaxerxes who stopped the rebuilding of the temple).
Further Artaxerxes makes a decree that anyone who wants can go with him. He offers generously out of the risk treasury so Ezra can offer appropriate offerings at the temple. He forbids anyone from taking tribute or tax from the priests and Levites. He even decrees that a Jewish judiciary is set up to administer Jewish law in their region, even having the powers of execution, banishment, fining and imprisonment.
Ezra is well versed in scripture, he wants to study God's word, do it and teach it.
Ezra thanks God for the King's kind help.

# Observations
It is remarkable that three pagan kings give so much help to the Jews. I'm not sure the kings had any special reverence for God among the many gods they worshipped and were worshipped in their Kingdom. Perhaps this treatment was common to people of all beliefs and it worked well to appease their subjects. In a way it shows the Jews weakness to be offering from what they have been given by the King rather than what they have grown, built, made or conquered.
