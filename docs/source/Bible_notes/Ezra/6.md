After a search is made a scroll is found with the decree of Cyrus. Darius honours the decree and adds to it that not only the building costs but also the animals for sacrifices are to be given to the Jews. Also he decreed that anyone who hinders the work of rebuilding the temple will be impaled on a beam taken from their own house.

The Jews finish the temple and dedicate it. Then they hold a Passover feast.
