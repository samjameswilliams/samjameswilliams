Ezra is told that the people left behind in the land have married foreign women and the leaders have been at the forefront.

Ezra is appalled and sits shocked until evening. Then he prays apologising to God on behalf of the people. He thanks the Lord for the remnant he has preserved of Israel, he says the Lord has not punished us as we deserve. He says he is ashamed and does not know how anyone can stand before God. 

He says that Israel should not have allowed themselves to intermarry or sight for their peace or prosperity.

# Observations
It is implied that the Israelites carried away into captivity did better at keeping themselves pure and not intermarrying than the ones left behind in Israel/Judah
