+ In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, Cyrus makes a proclamation that fulfills Jeremiah's prophecy. It is a repetition of the proclamation at the end of Chronicles
+ God has given me all the kingdoms of the world and he has asked me to build him a temple in Jerusalem. All who are able to go and help may go. And whoever goes should be assisted.
+ The priests, Levites and people go. Their neighbours give them gifts freely. Cyrus orders the things from the temple which Nebuchadnezzar had stolen be restored to the Jews
