>$^{12}$Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.  

Paul warns us against complacency. Against thinking we are strong and secure. The verse comes after listing out various sins of the people of Israel as they traveled through the desert. Some people think their heritage makes a difference, that being from a long line of believers  somehow makes them stronger. Paul's list shows how even if your ancestors are whom you might consider the best, you only inherit sin. When you think you are immune to temptation is when you are most prone to fall into it. 


>$^{13}$No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.  

Paul wisely follows up the above statement with this to show that he doesn't mean there's no use in resisting sin. Paul isn't saying that no one succeeds, so why try? For one thing he warns us against allowing ourselves to think that we're some special case. That our temptations are somehow  completely irresistible. Nothing has overtaken us that isn't *common*. But more importantly he points out that God is in control, even of the temptations that come our way and we need to have faith  and believe what Paul says that God always gives a way out. We also need to act on that faith and seek God's help when we're tempted.
