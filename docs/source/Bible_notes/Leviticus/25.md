## The year of Jubilee  

The year of Jubilee which was meant to occur every 50 years really puts anything modern bearing the name "Jubilee" in the shade. It was a huge event that would affect the whole society. During that year all land went back to its ancestral Israelite family, and any Israelites who had ended up in slavey were released.  

It can be easy to look at the Bible with a modern lens. One way in which we might do this is in the area of politics. Some people may say the Bible is why they're on the right and others why they're on the left. The fact is that the Bible is decidedly neither. The year of jubilee is very much a case in point. There is no modern equivalent to this.
