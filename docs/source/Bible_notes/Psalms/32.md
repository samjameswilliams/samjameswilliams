> $^1$Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven,
  whose sin is covered.
  $^2$Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity,
  and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
  $^3$For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away
  through my groaning all day long.
  $^4$For day and night your hand was heavy upon me;
  my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
  $^5$I acknowledged my sin to you,
and I did not cover my iniquity;
  I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,”
  and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah  

Here in the Old Testament Psalms we have a very clear description of how we should confess our sins to God and seek his forgiveness and how God is willing to forgive. 

David speaks about how dreadful the time was before he confessed. He likens his condition to having a wasting disease, having God as an enemy and being parched in the sun. 

> $^6$Therefore let everyone who is godly
  offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found;
  surely in the rush of great waters,
they shall not reach him.  

David pleads to anyone listening to this Psalm who may be in a similar state to go to God and confess quickly, because you do not have forever.
