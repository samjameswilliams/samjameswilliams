> $^{1a}$Unless the LORD builds the house,
  those who build it labour in vain.  

This verse has echoes of the opening of Ecclesiastes. The main difference here is that unlike the arresting exaggeration "all is vanity", the opening three words "unless the LORD" imply the incredible idea that it is possible to join with the LORD in his work. It also implies that this is the only way to find true purpose.

> $^{2b}$for he gives to his beloved sleep.
  $^3$Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD,
  the fruit of the womb a reward.

My wife Rach pointed out a funny irony in the juxtaposition of these verses. We've never had as little sleep in our lives as we've had since God blessed us with children. But our children are a wonderful blessing, a continual source of joy. That's not to say parenting is always easy. It is very hard when they're naughty and need discipline and punishment. It's worrying when they're badly ill. It can be extremely tiring even when everything is fine. But we love them very much and treasure the ways they show they love us. It's wonderful seeing them grow and change. We weren't able to have children quickly and easily. We wondered if we'd ever have them. Thinking back to how that felt always deepens our gratitude to the LORD for answering our prayers.
