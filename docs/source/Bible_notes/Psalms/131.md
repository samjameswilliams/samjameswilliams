>$^2$But I have calmed and quieted my soul,
  like a weaned child with its mother;
  like a weaned child is my soul within me.  

This is another verse which my wife Rach helped me understand. She pointed out that a nursing child is more nagging. When it's with its mother it is often nagging for milk and as it gets older it can be quite physical in its efforts to get the milk which makes it hard to just relax with the child in your lap. Once the child is weaned though it'll cuddle up peacefully with its mum just because it likes it. The child won't suddenly lunge for milk unexpectedly. Rach said how nice it is to hold a calm child without wondering if it's just come for milk. Perhaps there's an analogy in how we first come to God in need of salvation with that need very much in mind. Then as we mature we still need God but our love for him deepens and we don't just come to God in need but because we want to be with him.
