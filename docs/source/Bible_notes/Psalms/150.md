The final Psalm is an exuberant call to praise God. Verse 2 particularly jumps out to me

> $^2$Praise him for his mighty deeds;
  praise him according to his excellent greatness!

It’s a very concise reminder of what we should praise God for but there are a lot of things that come under
* his mighty deeds.  
* his excellent greatness.  

My prayers can so often be largely taken up with requests. My two year old daughter is much better at thinking of things that could fall under the mighty deeds category; squirrels, lambs, mummy, daddy, Josh, toys…

I should remember to thank the Lord more for what he has done, even things that might seem trite. We’ve received everything we have from him. I should also thank him for his qualities; his goodness, love, grace, power, wisdom, kindness, patience, justice, mercy…

I also love how we are encouraged to praise in an exuberant way, a noisy, musical, animated and joyful way;

> $^3$Praise him with trumpet sound;
  praise him with lute and harp!
  $^4$Praise him with tambourine and dance;
  praise him with strings and pipe!
  $^5$Praise him with sounding cymbals;
  praise him with loud clashing cymbals!
  $^6$Let everything that has breath praise the LORD!
  Praise the LORD!
