*$^{18}$Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.* 

There are many verses structured like proverbs throughout the book. A common proverbial style is to have a couplet that shows two sides to an issue. This verse preempts Ecclesiastes 10:10 in part of what it is saying. Wisdom can count for more than might. The history of war has shown this countless times where canny commanders and veteran soldiers have defeated more numerous and better equipped foes. But I think the verse is meant to apply to more than just warfare and the principle applies much more broadly. However, the second part of the couplet shows how limited man’s wisdom is. One sinner destroys much good. The couplet style reveals that the writer is counting “wisdom” as being synonymous with “righteous” and “sinner” with “foolish”. However wise we are our work may be undone by sinners.
