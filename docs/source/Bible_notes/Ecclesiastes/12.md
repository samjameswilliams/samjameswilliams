>$^{13}$The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. $^{14}$For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

There’s quite a bit of the Gospel message wrapped up in this closing thought from Ecclesiastes. It’s far from an explanation but it tells us not to just obey God’s commandments but to fear Him. This fear almost certainly means having faith in God when you take it in the context of the way the phrase is used throughout scripture. And though obedience is important it is nothing without faith since we are very bad at being obedient. 

It also reminds us that God will bring every deed into judgement. This is an awe inspiring thought, a God who never forgets and will take the trouble to remember everything in judgement. It's only because of God’s grace in sending Jesus to take the punishment we deserve that we can have hope in the face of that.
