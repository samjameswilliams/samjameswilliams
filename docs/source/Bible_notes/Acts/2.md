+ the day of Pentecost. The house where they were was filled with a rising wind. Tongues of fire settled on each of them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit and they spoke in tongues
+ A crowd gathered, perplexed because they each heard them in their own language speaking about the mighty acts of God
+ Peter addresses the crowd
+ he claims what they are seeing is the fulfillment of a prophesy of Joel
+  'everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved'
+ Jesus came with signs, you crucified him but death could not hold him and he rose to life
+ the crowd are cut to the heart and ask what they must do
+ Peter replies 'repent, believe and be baptised in the name of Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins'
+ 3000 added to their number that day
+ They devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching, breaking bread and fellowship. They had everything in common. They sold their possessions and gave to the poor. They recorded their food with thankfulness. God added to them daily. They had favour with the people.
