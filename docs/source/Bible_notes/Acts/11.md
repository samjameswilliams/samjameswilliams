The elders challenge Peter when he returns from seeing Claudius saying he should not have entered the house of someone uncircumcised or eaten with him. Peter tells them the vision of the animals on the cloth, the voice from heaven saying not to make a distinction. He explained how God had made it clear that salvation was not just for the Jews but for the Gentiles too. They are persuaded by Peter and are glad.

Believers are scattered as far as Phoenicia after Stephens execution because of the heavy persecution. Many of these scattered believers only talk to Jews but some evangelise to gentiles too. God brings many of the Gentiles in Antioch to believe. Barnabas is sent to help and rejoices to see the gentile believers. Paul is sent for and he spends a year in Antioch with the believers teaching them.
