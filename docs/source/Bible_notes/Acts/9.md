Saul encounters Jesus on the road to Damascus and is struck blind. Ananias is told to go to him to heal him. Ananias is afraid and asks isn't Saul here to throw Christians into prison? Jesus says he has chosen to use Saul and he will show Saul how much he must suffer for three name of Jesus.

Ananias good and heals Saul. Saul immediately starts preaching that Jesus is the son of God and proving it from the scriptures to everyone's amazement.

The Jewish leaders want to kill him so he goes to Jerusalem.

Peter heals a man paralysed for 8 years and raises Dorcas/Tabitha from the dead.
