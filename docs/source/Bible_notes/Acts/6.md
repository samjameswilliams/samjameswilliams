The widows are neglected in their share of the believers offerings. The apostles don't think it good that they give up any preaching or prayer to sort out these matters but they want the widows to be taken care of so they appoint deacons to make sure things are sorted out.

Stephen is doing miracles and preaching. His enemies cannot dispute with him successfully because of his wisdom. They accuse him of blasphemy against Moses and God and bring him before a tribunal.
