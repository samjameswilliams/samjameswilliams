Paul makes his defence to Agrippa. He points out that he his being persecuted because he believes in the things the Jews are hoping for. He tells about his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus and how he changed from someone who persecuted Christians into being one himself. He even tries to persuade Agrippa to believe.
