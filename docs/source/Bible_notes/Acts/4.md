+ the priests and Sadducees are angry at Peter and John for paving about Jesus so they arrest them
+ many people believed what they heard and after this there were about 5000 believers
+ Peter and John are summoned for a hearing in the morning with Annas the high priest and other high ranking priests.
+ They ask them in whose name they have spoken and acted
+ Peter says that the crippled man was healed in the name of Jesus, who you crucified, who was raised to life '“And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved...” (Act 4:12, ESV2011)'
+ The priests are amazed by their boldness, they know they are uneducated and that they had been with Jesus. With the man who was healed standing in front of them they are left speechless
+ They warn them not to speak in Jesus name but Peter says he will obey God not men
+ the priests let them go. They are reunited with the believers who praise God
+ they pay for boldness to preach the word of God. The place is shaken and they are filled with the Holy Spirit
+ The believers had everything in common. There were no poor among them
