Paul is questioned by Jewish leaders. They order him to be struck during the questioning. Paul rebukes them for having an uncondemned man struck. The Jews rebuke him for talking to the high priest in that way. Paul apologises quoting the scripture that forbids speaking ill of a ruler. 

When Paul perceived that the council were part Pharisee and part Saducee he cries out that it is because of the resurrection of the dead that he is on trial. The Pharisees jump to his defence and the Sadducees want him condemned. The council breaks up in confusion. 

Paul's nephew hears off a plot where forty Jewish men take an oath not to eat till they have killed Paul. They ask the Jewish leaders to request Paul for more questioning so they can kill him while he's on his way. 

Paul's nephew tells Paul who tells the guard to take his nephew to the tribune. The tribune heard what the nephew has to say and organised an armed escort of 200 foot soldiers, 70 cavalry and possibly some spearmen too to escort Paul in safety to Felix the Governor. 

The tribune sends a letter with Paul explaining why he has sent him but he omits to mention he wrongfully bound him.
