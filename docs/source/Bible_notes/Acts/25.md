In this chapter Festus proves to be as unjust and self interested as Felix. He delays hearing Paul and tries to palm him back over to the Jews to try him in Jerusalem. He's clearly trying to curry favour with the Jews and doesn't care one bit about justice. It ought to be plain that the Jews will condemn Paul against the Roman law if he even gets there without being murdered on his way there. Paul appeals to Caesar, after a short deliberation Festus agrees to send him to Caesar. Festus seems to be quite chummy with king Agrippa, they chat about Paul and Agrippa asks to hear him. So Festus arranges a hearing and the nobles all arrive in great pomp. It's shameful, it's like the court of law is being treated by the nobles like a kind of entertainment.
