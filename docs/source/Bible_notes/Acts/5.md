Ananias and Sapphira sell some of their property and bring part of the proceeds to the apostles but they say it is all of the proceeds. Peter rebukes Ananias saying the land was his to do with as he wished and so was the money but he has lied not to man but to God. Ananias falls down dead after hearing this and the young men take him out and bury him and everyone is filled with fear.
Sapphira comes in unawares. Peter asks her if they sold the land for so much. Sapphira says yes for that amount. Peter asks her why she and her husband agreed to test the Lord and she will be carried out by the same men who carried her husband out. She also does and is buried next to her husband. The church is filled with fear 
The apostles teach and heal the sick and many believe.
The apostles are arrested by the religious leaders but freed in the night by an angel.
I'm the morning the leaders summon the prisoners but they cannot be found. Then they hear they are preaching in the temple. They have them brought but not by force because of fear of the people. 
They say they are trying to bring Jesus's blood on them, that they are filling the place with their teaching after being told to stop. 
Peter replies as before that they must obey God not men. They let them go after beating them.
Gamaliel advises the council to leave them alone. If it is of man it will fail like Thuadas and Judas. If it is of God they will not be able to stand against them and may be found opposing God.
