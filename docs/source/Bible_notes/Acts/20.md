# 20

Paul speaks late into the night and a youth falls from the third storey window and is brought up dead. Paul says his life is in him and he goes away alive and they were not a little comforted.

Paul tells the believers he is going to Jerusalem because the Spirit has told him to go but that danger and death await him and he knows he will not see them again. They weep with him.
