After getting safely to shore the islanders of Malta are very kind to the people who were on the boat. They light a fire and look after them. A viper bites Paul which he shakes off into the fire. Initially the Maltese think Paul must be a murderer so the gods haven't let him live even after he survived the shipwreck. Then when he comes to no harm they change their minds and think he's a god. The ship's passengers stay in Malta over the winter and finish their journey to Rome in the spring. The Jews in Rome have heard nothing bad about Paul but they have heard 'the Way' spoken against. They are happy to hear Paul. Paul spends a day explaining to them about Jesus but it seems that in the end they mostly reject the message. The book concludes saying that Paul lived in Rome, living at his own expense. It seems the justice system largely forgot him and left him imprisoned but free to speak. 

## Observations
I like the way Luke describes the Maltese. They are not believers. Some Christians seem to interpret Calvin's doctrine of total depravity as requiring them to speak badly or suspiciously of unbelievers and well of believers. Luke doesn't speak like this, he speaks gratefully of the kindness shown to him by unbelieving, superstitious isolators. People aren't saved by their attitude, words or actions but by putting their faith in Christ. This knowledge doesn't oblige us to speak badly of people who don't believe. Unbelievers can act more righteously than believers in any given situation. We shouldn't feel obliged to seek ulterior motives or qualify any gratitude we show towards the kindness from unbelievers.
