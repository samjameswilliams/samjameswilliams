Luke gives a very vivid and detailed description of how they get more and more into trouble on the sea voyage because the weather is so bad for so long. Before setting sail Paul warns them that the voyage would involve injury and loss of life but they would not listen to him and set out anyway. After things were pretty desperate Paul has a vision which he shared with the other passengers that God has told him that only the ship would be lost, all the passengers would survive. Shortly after the sailors try to escape on the ship's boat but Paul tells the soldiers to stop them because they will die without the sailors so the soldiers cut the ropes off the ships boat and let it float away empty. They spot a beach and try to run aground but hit a reef. The soldiers want to kill the prisoners before abandoning ship but the centurion prevents them to save Paul's life. All 276 passengers make it ashore safely.
