>*$^{13}$…I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.*

>though your sins are like scarlet,
>they shall be as white as snow;
>though they are red like crimson,
>they shall become like wool.
>$^{19}$If you are willing and obedient,
>you shall eat the good of the land;
>$^{20}$but if you refuse and rebel,
>you shall be eaten by the sword;
>for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.*

These verses seem to me to contain the main messages of the chapter. God cannot stand false and hypocritical religion in His name. Nevertheless God is offering forgiveness if people will turn from their sin, but he is warning of terrible retribution if people ignore the warning. 

I’m strongly of the opinion that as believers we are meant to take warning from the passages about the wayward Israelites and Pharisees in the New Testament. These are the ways in which religious people fall. We shouldn’t merely assume we aren’t like that, we should examine ourselves to see if we aren’t falling into the same kinds of traps. It’s interesting that a greater importance is placed on how the Israelites live day to day than on their ceremonies.
