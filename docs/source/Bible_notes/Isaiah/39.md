Envoys from Babylon arrive and Hezekiah shows them all the wealth of his kingdom. Isaiah comes after they’ve left and asks Hezekiah who they were and what he showed them. After Hezekiah told him they were from Babylon and he showed them everything Isaiah prophesies that Babylon will conquer Israel, and carry away its riches, people and even some of Hezekiah’s sons. 

It’s unclear if Isaiah is rebuking or warning Hezekiah or simply passing a message from God to him. I’m not sure if there’s any reason why a king shouldn’t show envoys around like Solomon did with the Queen of Sheba. So I’m inclined to think it’s a warning rather than a rebuke. 

Hezekiah’s response is hard to understand. He simply responds to Isaiah that the word from the Lord is good and we’re told he was content that there would be peace in his time. This lack of concern, even for his own sons is baffling. Hezekiah is a good king but there’s something very wrong with his utter lack of concern for what doesn’t affect him personally.
