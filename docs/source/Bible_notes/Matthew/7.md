>$^{11}$*If you then, **who are evil**, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!*

The phrase “who are evil” is a deeply humbling one. This is the verdict of God on what we are. The word evil isn’t one that most people use often or lightly. It’s the word most people would reserve to describe the very worst kind of people or actions. But Jesus here applies it to ordinary mums and dads and is surely using them as an “Everyman” example.
