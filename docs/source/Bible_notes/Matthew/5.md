## Anger v21 - 26
It has always stuck out to me how it is not merely enough to restrain yourself from acting in anger but you mustn’t bear grudges and hate people inwardly. Jesus then moves on to talk about how if we know someone has something against us that it is more important to sort it out with them and be reconciled than to go to the place of worship. We aren’t just to be concerned about the state of our own hearts but we must do what we can to make it easier for others to be holy too. It is wrong to be angry with your brother so it is also wrong to leave things as they are if you know someone is understandably angry with you. You are tempting the other person to sin and bear you a grudge.
