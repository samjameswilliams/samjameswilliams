*$^4$ Who has ascended to heaven and come down?
Who has gathered the wind in his fists?
Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is his name, and what is his son's name?
Surely you know!*  

The thing that sticks out to me the most is the reference to a “son”. Who could this be talking about but God, who else has “established all the ends of the earth”? It’s fascinating to see these hints about Jesus in the Old Testament, often quite mysterious and without explanation.
