I find it so easy to fall foul of this. I very easily offer to do things at work without thinking about whether I have the time to do it. It’s especially easy if I know it’s something worth doing that I want to do. 

As Jesus points out in his parable of the two sons it’s better to say you won’t do something but then do it than the other way around.
