> *<sup>11</sup> A fool gives full vent to his spirit,
  but a wise man quietly holds it back.*  

This is something of a counter to the encouragements to bring rebuke when needed although I think it is taking more about gossip and slander. It’s very much easier to say bad things about someone than to say it to them. When we’re angry at someone this is a good verse to remember. 

> *$^{15}$ The rod and reproof give wisdom,
  but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
  …
  $^{17}$ Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;
  he will give delight to your heart.*  

Physical punishment is looked down on in society now, but it is encouraged in scripture. It actually warns of the consequences of not doing it. Parenting is hard. It’s so much easier to not punish or to punish too harshly than to get it right. But ultimately it should do our children good. Discipline isn’t necessarily about punishment but is also about setting good habits, fostering a good attitude to work and good behaviour in general.
