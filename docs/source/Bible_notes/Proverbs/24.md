# 24

*11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death;
hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.
12 If you say, “Behold, we did not know this,”
does not he who weighs the heart perceive it?
Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it,
and will he not repay man according to his work?*  

It seems to me that these verses could have a literal and a metaphorical meaning. In its original context the literal meaning to not let people go to their deaths may have been something the original hearers had to deal with more commonly than we tend to. Many people lived through turbulent times. It’s easy to imagine how easy it could be to not want to put your own life in danger to try and protect someone else’s, to turn a blind eye and be callously indifferent. Verse 12 reminds us that God sees everything. 

The metaphorical meaning could extend to us seeking to protect others not only from mortal harm but other kinds too, financial, reputational, physical. Being concerned for the well-being of others. 

It could also be applied to wanting to see people saved and be a spur to evangelise.
