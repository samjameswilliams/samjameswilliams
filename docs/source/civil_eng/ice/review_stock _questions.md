# ICE IEng and CEng interview: stock questions
The ICE reviewers (or assessors if you’re an apprentice) will be asking questions to satisfy themselves that  the candidate either does or doesn’t have the attributes the ICE requires of a professional member. The reviewers have a free hand to choose whatever questions they want and normally the bulk of questions will be tailored to the candidate’s particular experience or anything that seemed lacking to the reviewers when they read the candidate’s report. However, there are some questions that come up pretty frequently. Knowing the answers to these won’t guarantee passing a review by any stretch, but not knowing them will look bad and could mean failing.

### Could you draw a free body diagram, shear force diagram and/or bending moment diagram of that structure?
