# Is the ICE Royal Charter at odds with the idea of intellectual property?

I have always worked in an engineering consultancy so in sharing my thoughts on this topic I'll be focusing predominantly on the ways intellectual property (IP) affects my own corner of the industry.

There are several different ways in which IP is held:

* patents - which are bought, have a limited duration, are applicable only in certain territories, protect a functional idea or design which needs to be disclosed in the patent. Amongst other things this is used for inventions and products  

* copyright - which protects written works from being copied without the author's consent. The duration of protection is typically far longer than for patents (70 years after the author's death) and is automatic from the point the work is created. This protects reports, books, databases and software  

* Trademarks - this protects brands and logos and will not be much of a feature in this article  

* Trade secrets - this is the practice of keeping valuable knowledge of any kind (chemical composition, methodologies, designs, software, manufacturing processes etc) secret. There is no legal protection for trade secrets unlike the above forms of IP which all allow for litigation  

Patents are something I have no direct experience with (engineers who work in manufacturing will think about this much more than me). Within consultancy copyright and trade secrets are the common forms of IP so I will focus on these.

For a long time I have doubted whether the way IP is used in consultancy is beneficial. It is something that is deeply entrenched and it can be hard to imagine alternatives. However, at its heart it is a deliberate suppression of the spread of knowledge (or the beneficial use of a certain knowledge). I just can't help but feel that there is something inherently bad about that.  

However, producing designs and researching to gain new knowledge involves work, often a lot of hard work. It is important that this work can be paid for. In my opinion this economic need is the strongest argument in favour of holding intellectual property.

Some key parts of the Royal Charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) concerning this topic are

>“[the ICE is] a Society for the general advancement of Mechanical Science, and more particularly for promoting the acquisition of that species of knowledge which constitutes the profession of a Civil Engineer”

The above quotation is the one that most directly challenges the practice of holding intellectual property. If it is true that  holding IP suppresses the spread of the kind of knowledge the ICE seeks to make sure people can obtain. 

>“in the interests of public health and safety it is accordingly of importance that there should be a ready means as heretofore of ascertaining persons who by proper training and experience are qualified to carry out such works.”

This is less directly related to the issue but if you keep your methods secret it's harder for others to assess if you know what you're doing.

Protectionism vs free trade
Guilds vs professional institutions 
Holding on to work vs winning work

Earning a living
Creating knowledge
Spreading knowledge
Ensuring people are qualified
Increasing productivity
Accountability

Owners and creators

Software can stifle understanding. Proprietary software is a black box. Open source can be a bewildering and large box. Are black boxes bad? Don't we all use them?

Bell labs C and Unix. Forced open source, attempt to close the stable door

Morality. Bible quotations. Robin Hood engineer bandits. Klaus Fuchs 

Red Hat, Microsoft, Google

Implementation, can it be separated from principles? Engineering software. What price can you set on a nice GUI? Proprietary software is all built on open source. 

Making code open source makes it open to scrutiny, but that doesn't guarantee better quality

Consultancies, trainers, publishers vs government bodies and academic institutions. Professional institutions. Thomas Telford publishing

What value can consultants provide? Secret knowledge, experience, resources (human, licenses, hardware), PII

How can consultancies and software houses be encouraged to share their knowledge? Altruism, not much appetite. Reputation, maybe some more motivation but still not likely to lead to much. Client sponsorship, special commissions. H R Wallingford, CIRIA SUDs, 

Benefits. Dissemination of knowledge
