# Writing a great report for professional review with the Institution of Civil Engineers   

*Opinions of an ICE reviewer*  

## How important is the report?

Ultimately the decision to admit a candidate as a member of the Institution of Civil
Engineers (ICE) comes down to the judgement of the two reviewers assigned to the 
candidate. 
They need to make a decision based on if they are satisfied the candidate has the 
[attributes](https://www.ice.org.uk/membership/attributes-for-professionally-qualified-membership) the ICE expects of a member at the level they are applying for.  

That judgement has to be made on the basis of:

* the candidate's report (read 3 times taking notes, approximately 3 - 4 hours)  
* the candidate's presentation on the review day (15 minutes)  
* the interview on the review day (45 minutes - 60 minutes)  
* the written assignment on the review day (20 minutes to read)  

As you can see from the approximate timings above the reviewers spend much more time
going over the report than they spend with the candidate on the day. The reviewers 
normally decide whether the candidate passes or fails in the minutes after the 
interview is over (yes, before the written assignment). 

The interview is the centrepiece of the process, but a great report will generally set a 
candidate up for a great review. If the report gives all the evidence the reviewers 
need, all they really need to do is ask questions to satisfy themselves the candidate
really did what they said or that the report wasn't written by someone else. On the 
other hand if the report doesn't prove the candidate has the attributes then the reviewers will have a barrage of questions they'll need good answers to in the interview. Worse, if the report contains things that make the reviewers concerned, they'll have some awkward and searching questions to ask.

## Know the attributes    

### Is the candidate ready?  

### The report should be about how the candidate demonstrates the attributes
