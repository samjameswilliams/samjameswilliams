# Ecclesiastes 5:1-7, 9:1-2, 12:1-14: The spirit returns to God who gave it

## Introduction
In these passages we are considering Solomon speaks about God. He never makes any attempt to prove God’s existence, instead he simply confronts us with the reality that God does exist and presents us with some of the consequences.

Some of the key messages are:  
* *God will bring every deed into judgement, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.* Ecc 12:14  
* *God is in heaven and you are on earth* Ecc 5:2  

The primary purpose of Solomon writing these passages is to encourage us to show God the reverence and awe that he is due and to warn us against taking God lightly or ignoring him. Solomon also wants remind us that our time is limited. One day we will stand before the LORD. 

I remember reading these passages for the first time and being struck by the way they made me really think about what it will be like to stand before God and that it really will happen.  

## The sacrifice of fools
The passage in chapter 5 makes us think about how in our:
* giving
* prayers
* what we say and 
* our vows (and promises)  

We should show the proper respect for The LORD. 

## Conclusion
In the sermon on the mount Jesus says:  
*25 Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. 26 Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.* Matt 5:25-26  

This is talking about how we should be with other people when we know we have done wrong, but in some ways it is even more applicable when taken as an image of how we stand in relationship to God. Not all criminals are taken to court, and some innocent people are. However, Solomon tells us that we will all stand before God one day and 
*Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.* Ecc 7:20  

Like the man in Jesus’ parable we should not forget that we are heading to court and the judgement will not go in our favour. But there is time to go and plead for mercy and God is gracious to forgive us our sins.
