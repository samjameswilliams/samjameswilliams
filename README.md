### Welcome to Sam Williams' personal GitHub repo

- I'm a Civil Engineer working in the UK water industry interested in using coding for solving engineering problems
- I’m currently working on how to make use of my coding skills as a civil engineer. This includes working out how to get people started without scaring them off, quality assurance and setting standards for calculations done in Jupyter Notebooks and (most interestingly to me) trying to set a precedent on how to build internal Python libraries with GitHub Enterprise (sorry, can't show anyone outside work) pytest, Sphinx, Poetry and other good tooling and practices.
- I’m interested in learning SQL but never seem to get around to it
- I am a christian

I'm planning on making this repo the place where I store my faith and work related notes. Over the years I've lost so many useful notes I've made on this, that and the other I thought I'd try going digital. Also means that when I build my notes into html using Sphinx it'll be searchable.
